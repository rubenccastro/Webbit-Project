# Webbit

Webbit is a social media platform that is heavily influenced by Reddit. However, instead of communities or "subwebs," Webbit organizes content into categories. These categories serve as a way for users to easily find content that they are interested in and engage with other users who share their interests.

Like Reddit, Webbit allows users to upvote and downvote content within each category, with the most popular posts rising to the top. However, unlike Reddit, Webbit does not have specific communities with their own moderators and rules. Instead, the content within each category is moderated by a team of moderators who enforce community guidelines and ensure that the content is appropriate for the category.

Overall, Webbit is a platform that takes inspiration from Reddit but uses a different organizational structure. By grouping content into categories rather than communities, Webbit aims to make it easier for users to find and engage with the content that interests them.
